What is Foreign Key ?
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

Why use Foreign Key?
To avoid inconsistent data from being entered (data integrity and data consistency)
This is achieved by maintaining the relationships between tables, preventing actions that would destroy these links.
