5.  What is "let"  keyword in javascript? Diff. between  "var" and "left" keyword?

The let declaration declares re-assignable, block-scoped local variables, optionally initializing each to a value.
Syntax
let name1;
let name1 = value1;
let name1 = value1, name2 = value2;
let name1, name2 = value2;
let name1 = value1, name2, /* â€¦, */ nameN = valueN;


Compared with var, let declarations have the following differences:

let declarations are scoped to blocks as well as functions.
let declarations can only be accessed after the place of declaration is reached (see temporal dead zone). For this reason, let declarations are commonly regarded as non-hoisted.
let declarations do not create properties on globalThis when declared at the top level of a script.
let declarations cannot be redeclared by any other declaration in the same scope.
let begins declarations, not statements. That means you cannot use a lone let declaration as the body of a block (which makes sense, since there's no way to access the variable).
