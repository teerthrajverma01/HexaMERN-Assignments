How to skip testcases?
Skipping test cases can be a tricky decision, as it might hide potential issues in your code. However, there are scenarios where skipping tests temporarily can be justified, such as when a certain feature is still in development or when a test is failing due to external factors beyond your control. 
JavaScript (using Mocha):
describe('My tests', function() {
    it.skip('should do something', function() {
        // Test code here
    });
});
