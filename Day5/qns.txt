What are data structure? Why do we need?

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that allow us to organize, store, and manage data efficiently. They define the way data is arranged, accessed, and manipulated in a computer's memory. Data structures are essential because they provide various operations for efficiently storing and retrieving data, depending on the requirements of a particular problem or application.

Here are some reasons why we need data structures:
Organizing Data
Efficient Data Access
Memory Management
Optimizing Operations
Abstraction and Encapsulation
Facilitating Code Reuse



What are the applications of stack and queue in real-time applications?

Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures with various real-time applications. 

Applications of Stacks:
Function Call Stack
Expression Evaluation
Backtracking Algorithms
Undo Mechanisms
Browser History

Applications of Queues:

Task Scheduling
Print Queue
Message Queues
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Buffering in I/O Operations
