3.Find details about following methods:
1.JSON.stringify()
The JSON.stringify() static method converts a JavaScript value to a JSON string, optionally replacing values if a replacer function is specified or optionally including only the specified properties if a replacer array is specified.
syntax: JSON.stringify(value, opt_replacer, opt_space)
console.log(JSON.stringify({ x: 5, y: 6 }));// Expected output: '{"x":5,"y":6}'

syntax: JSON.parse(text, opt_reviver)
const json = '{"result":true, "count":42}';
const obj = JSON.parse(json);
console.log(obj);// Expected output:{ result: true, count: 42 }
